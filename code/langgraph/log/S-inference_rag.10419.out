Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /home/shbae/.triton/autotune, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.
[2025-03-22 17:22:11,141] [WARNING] [runner.py:215:fetch_hostfile] Unable to find hostfile, will proceed with training with local resources only.
Detected VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 but ignoring it because one or several of --include/--exclude/--num_gpus/--num_nodes cl args were used. If you want to use CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES don't pass any of these arguments to deepspeed.
